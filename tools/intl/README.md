# Native Intl data tools

These Python 3.6 or newer host tools prepare immutable source data for native
Intl generation. Normal builds use prepared binary data and do not download
or parse XML.

## Acquire the pinned inputs

```sh
python3 tools/intl/acquire.py --cache /path/to/intl-cache
python3 tools/intl/acquire.py --cache /path/to/intl-cache --offline
```

`pin.json` identifies CLDR 49 beta 4 by release tag, commit, archive SHA-256 and
the SHA-256 of its complete source manifest. This prerelease was deliberately
selected for Unicode 18 support. An upgrade must replace the pins and regenerate
and validate the data; the tool never follows a development branch or `latest`.

The archive comes from the complete release source tree. Its `common/` files
and license are materialized under `cldr-49-beta4` in the cache. The generator
can therefore apply explicit draft/alternate selection instead of inheriting
the production ZIP's filtering. Java source and other programs in the archive
are not executed or installed.

Acquisition verifies the archive and the complete file inventory before writing
source files. Existing correct files are retained; missing or modified cache
files are repaired from the authenticated archive, including in offline mode.
Downloads, member counts, expanded sizes and individual files have bounds.
Archive links, unsafe paths and source-cache symlinks are rejected.

## Consume verified source files

Collectors use `acquire.Sources` with the cache's `cldr-49-beta4` directory.
The reader authenticates the manifest before use, verifies each consumed file,
and tracks logical input paths for generated provenance. Cache paths and file
timestamps are not provenance. The XML interpretation, inheritance resolution
and binary encoding are separate layers described in
[the Intl design](../../doc/intl-design.md#cldr-xml-collection-and-resolution).

Tests in `tests/test_intl_sources.py` use small authored archives and perform no
network access. CI also acquires the real pinned archive. These checks establish
source reproducibility; they do not establish formatter or locale coverage.
